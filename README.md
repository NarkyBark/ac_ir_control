Working on using a [Particle Core](http://docs.particle.io/core/) to control a
bunch of window AC units.

Thanks to the great work by [AnalysIR](http://www.analysir.com/) to document how
to [capture long IR codes](http://www.analysir.com/blog/2014/03/19/air-conditioners-problems-recording-long-infrared-remote-control-signals-arduino/)
and figure out how to [send IR from a Particle Core](http://www.analysir.com/blog/2015/06/10/simple-infrared-pwm-on-arduino-part-2-raw-ir-signals/).
